#Mail Sender

## Ideology 
The Ideology behind this repo is to automate the processes of sending mails. 
I use this project whenever I have to send similar mails to more than 3 people.

## Setup
In djangoMailer/djangoMailer folder, change file name of sample_email_credentials.py  to email_credentials.py 
Change email_credentials according to your own settings
